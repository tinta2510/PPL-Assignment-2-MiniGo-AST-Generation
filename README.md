# PPL-Assignment-2-MiniGo-AST-Generation

## Overview
This project is the second assignment for the Principles of Programming Languages (CO3005) course at HCMC University of Technology (VNU-HCM). It continues from [Assignment 1](https://github.com/tinta2510/PPL-Assignment-1-MiniGo-Lexer-and-Recognizer), where a lexer and parser were implemented for the MiniGo language.

The objective of this assignment is to generate an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** from a syntactically correct MiniGo program. The AST is a structured representation of the program that captures its syntax and semantics, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.

The AST generator uses the **Visitor pattern** to traverse the parse tree generated by ANTLR and build a structured tree using pre-defined AST classes.

## Features
- Translate parse trees into ASTs using Python.
- Use the **Visitor pattern** to traverse and manipulate trees with typed nodes.
- Supports full AST generation for MiniGo syntax, including:
  - Variable and constant declarations
  - Type declarations (structs, interfaces)
  - Function and method declarations
  - Expressions and control flow (if statements, for loops, return statements)
- 100 test cases to validate the correctness of the AST generation.

## Environment Setup
Refer to the [Assignment 1](https://github.com/tinta2510/PPL-Assignment-1-MiniGo-Lexer-and-Recognizer).

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Generate the parser and lexer (if modified):
   ```bash
   python run.py gen
   ```
3. Run the AST test suite:
   ```bash
   python run.py test ASTGenSuite
   ```

## Project Files
- `MiniGo.g4`: Updated grammar file reused from Assignment 1.
- `ASTGeneration.py`: Implements the core logic to convert the parse tree into an AST.
- `AST.py`: Contains the definitions of AST classes used to represent different constructs in the MiniGo language.
- `ASTGenSuite.py`: Contains 100 test cases to validate AST correctness.
